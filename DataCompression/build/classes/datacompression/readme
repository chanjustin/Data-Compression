This program uncompresses (or decodes) a message stored as 0s and 1s in any one
of the .pre files stored in the "testdata" folder of this package.

The program utilizes the prefix free code printed in the first 1 to 3 lines
of each of the .pre files to build up a binary tree that the program can then
use for decompression.

This is a technique known as the huffman coding is detailed on the wikipedia page
and the assignment page for this project.
